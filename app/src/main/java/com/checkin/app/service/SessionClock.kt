 * The two numbers a session's elapsed time is drawn from, kept out of [CheckInService] so they are
 * JVM-unit-testable — a `Service` is not, and this is the most visible figure the app has, the one a
 * user reads to decide whether to check out.
 *
 * The notification uses [chronometerBase] and lets the platform count; the Check-In screen's ticker
 * uses [elapsedMs] once a second. **Both go through here**, so a hand-rolled copy of the subtraction
 * cannot fix the floor rule in one and miss it in the other.
 *
 * Elapsed time is plain wall-clock since check-in; nothing subtracts from it.
